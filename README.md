This is the third project I've worked on, and took around 3 weeks to make. Thank you for taking a look!

# Only works on windows

# Controls
- A/D -> Move left/right
- Q/E -> Rotate anticlockwise/clockwise
- S -> Toggle soft drop
- W -> Hold block

# Info
- To play, click on the green code button, download and extract the zip file, and run Tetris.exe
- Clearing 1 line at a time gives you 100 points, 2 lines 300, 3 lines 500 and 4 lines 800. This value is then multiplied by the speed
- Your speed increases by 1 for every 5 lines you clear. The maximum speed is 11.
- Soft dropping is a toggle. Please don't hold it down as you may break the game, or make it so your other inputs are not processed.
